# clamislandCalendar
this is a tool that aggregates the pearl countdown from user input and creates a dynamic ICS file

The tool can be run on any php-enabled (>5.4) server.
It is already running at https://clamislandpearls.moviephone.in/ - just import the link into your favorite calendar app! :)

The form to input the data into the google sheet is here: https://forms.gle/rWYKoS7jTnA6PNe16
